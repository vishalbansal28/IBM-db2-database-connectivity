# IBM DB2 Connectivity with Spring Boot

This project demonstrates how to connect a Spring Boot application to an IBM DB2 database using Java.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to showcase the connectivity between a Spring Boot application and an IBM DB2 database.

## Components

- **Spring Boot Application:** Core of the project handling HTTP requests/responses and database interactions.
- **IBM DB2 Database:** Storage and management of data.

## Features

- **REST API:** Implemented using Spring Boot to expose endpoints for database interaction.
- **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database through the REST API.

## Additional Topics Covered

- **Docker:** usage for containerizing the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure the IBM DB2 database connection properties in the Spring Boot application.
3. Build and run the Spring Boot application.
4. Test the REST API endpoints using tools like Postman.
